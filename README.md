# Hybrid Powertrain Sizing Simulation
## Objective
This project is the final project in the course AUE 817 Alterative Powertrain, which I took at Clemson Unveracity in 2014.
The goal is to size the powertrain components (e.g. engine, motor, battery) to meet the fuel economy and performance target for an SUV and verify it in Simulink model.

## Usage 
1.Put all the file in the root directory   
2.run “Group3_Initialization.m” in Matlab to initialize the simulation   
3.run "Group3_HEV_model.mdl" in Simulink to complete the simulation   
4.run "Group3_Plot.m" in Matlab to visualize the result    

## Software Requirements:
Matlab, Simulink 2013 or the newer version.
